# Neural Net

This repository contains an generalizable, single hidden layer neural network created in Python. It also contains a training script to train the neural net to classify digits (numbers 0-9) based on pixel values. Approximately 95% accuracy is achieved with sufficient training time. The neural net takes advantage of backpropogation to update its weights.
